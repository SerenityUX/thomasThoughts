        <p>When I determined to make something happen, I get tunnel vision and suddenly it is all that matters</p>
        <p>This sometimes leads to me not listening to the people around me. I may forget to think about what would be best for them. This may lead to people losing trust in me or thinking I do not respect them.</p>
        <p>This is a bit of a hard problem to solve. Having focus is good, but when I talk to people I need to closely listen so I can consider their concerns.</p>
        <p>This is a problem I've had for much of my life. I think about being a young minecraft player (maybe 9yr old) & would family would visit, instead of spending time with them, I would just work on my minecraft server. This probably led to them thinking that I do not want to spend time with them. I think I've found a better balance with family where now I do spend time with family for a bit whem they visit but into the night, I'll communicate that I am going to work on my project. </p>
        <p>This is defintely an area I can grow. The solution is not obvious other than listening to people more closely when I talk with them and taking what they say with utmost importance. It should not be something that I quickly forget about.</p>
